# Datahound Migration Brief (Windows -> Ubuntu)       
               
Goal: run app locally on Ubuntu VM with reproducible setup.      
Current stack: Python 3 + Streamlit.
Out of scope for now: enterprise rewrite/refactor/systems design.
Definition of done:               
1) setup script works from clean Ubuntu               
2) app starts successfully        
3) critical user flow works locally 
4) runbook exists (install/run/troubleshoot)
